There are many ways to contribute to Open\+E\+SS, with the most common ones being contribution of code or documentation to the project. Improving the documentation is no less important than improving the library itself. If you find a typo in the documentation, or have made improvements, do not hesitate to send an email to the mailing list or preferably submit a Git\+Hub pull request. Documentation can be found \href{https://roseleblood.github.io/openess/html/d3/dcc/md__r_e_a_d_m_e.html}{\tt Docu}.

But there are many other ways to help. In particular answering queries on the \href{https://github.com/RoseLeBlood/openess/issues}{\tt issue tracker}, investigating bugs, and reviewing other developers\textquotesingle{} pull requests are very valuable contributions that decrease the burden on the project maintainers.

Another way to contribute is to report issues you\textquotesingle{}re facing, and give a \char`\"{}thumbs
up\char`\"{} on issues that others reported and that are relevant to you. It also helps us if you spread the word\+: reference the project from your blog and articles, link to it from your website, or simply star it in Git\+Hub to say \char`\"{}\+I use it\char`\"{}.
